            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>How do we track reading progress in children and motivate them to read? 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Encouraging reading in children is important as research suggests that early-reading 
                helps in the development of reading-related cognitive skills.

                As such, parents have been looking for ways to encourage, foster and monitor their 
                childrenâ€™s reading habits.

                Currently there are apps available that track reading 
                progress in e-books, such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle&hl=en">Kindle</a>
                 and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.readera&hl=en">ReadEra</a>. 
                 Apps that teach children to pronounce words and learn to construct sentences, like 
                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.starfall.ltr">Starfall</a> 
                and <a href="https://www.learnwithhomer.com/?utm_source=Brightlyblog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=TopAppsBrightly&utm_term=engagement&utm_content=Brightly052417">
                    Homer</a>, are also available as applications and websites.
            </p>
            <p>The studies for early reading in children primarily focuses on parents 
                reading to their children, 
                <cite><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2158244016672715">(Niklas, F., Cohrssen, C., & Tayler, C., 2016)</a></cite> 
                but parents may not recall how many books they have read to their child. The applications I 
                mentioned primarily concern reading material available within the applications or e-books. However,
                I have not found apps that provide additional support for physical children's books. I feel that an 
                application that allows both physical and digital books to be tracked and generate checkpoints
                to achieve goals would provide a more comprehensive report on a child's reading progress and facilitate 
                additional avenues of incentive.
                For the purposes of this project, I will be focusing on English-speaking children in the United States.</p>

            <!-- Proposed Application -->
            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>The main users of this application will be parents of children between the
                ages of 3 to 12 years old. These parents will be inputting their children's 
                reading progress in the form of adding books and noting the pages they have
                gone through. This is to ensure that children are unable to cheat the system.
            </p>
            <p>The statistics that are shown will appear in the form of line graphs 
                and bar charts showing the number of pages and books read over days, months,
                and years. The number of hours spent reading can also be recorded. 
                As more books are read, a virtual plant is grown on the site and 
                children can try to make the plant produce more flowers by reading more.
            </p>
            <p>In this way, I hope children will be motivated to get the tallest
                plant among their friends. Parents can add their children's friends
                 and in this way, foster a competitive spirit and add additional motivation.
            </p>
